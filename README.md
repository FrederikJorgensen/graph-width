> In graph theory, the treewidth of an undirected graph is a number associated with the graph. Treewidth may be defined in several equivalent ways: from the size of the largest vertex set in a tree decomposition of the graph, from the size of the largest clique in a chordal completion of the graph - Wikipedia

[GraphWidth.com](http://www.graphwidth.com/) is a full-stack application aimed at anyone with an interest in graph width measures and their applications. The teaching is done through short & precise interactive lectures. Along with a 
'sandbox mode' for those who wish to explore the concepts without guidance.
