# Graph Width Visualizer


![](readmeimg.png)

> In graph theory, the treewidth of an undirected graph is a number associated with the graph. Treewidth may be defined in several equivalent ways: from the size of the largest vertex set in a tree decomposition of the graph, from the size of the largest clique in a chordal completion of the graph - Wikipedia

## Development

Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FrederikJorgensen/graph-width-visualizer.git
```  
Change directory into the repository:  
```bash
cd graph-width-visualizer
```

Install the development tools:  
```bash
npm install
```    
Run the application:  
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app is then running at:
